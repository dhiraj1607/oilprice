    <h1>Oil in Turm-oil!</h1>
    <p><em>The simplified explanation behind the recent sub-zero oil prices.</em></p>
    <p>The oil market is experiencing one of its darkest moments in history.
On Monday, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark grade for oil prices was trading at negative prices.<br>So, what exactly happened? Let us try to understand.</p>
<hr size="4">
    <h2>What exactly was negative price?</h2>
    <p>It was the <strong><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp">FUTURES CONTRACTS</a></strong> for oil to be delivered in the month of May that plunged to negative values.<br>The value of Futures Contracts for the month of June is low but is positive at about $21 per barrel, on 20th April 2020, while the corresponding price for May was about $-37 per barrel.

    <h2>Basics, check! Now why did the oil prices fall below zero?</h2>
    <p>It all boils down to the juxtaposition of the human emotion of greed and the basic <strong>Demand and Supply concept of Economics</strong>- the price of any commodity or service depends on the demand and its supply.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The BUY Side (Demand)</strong>: In case of the Oil Fiasco, the demand plunged unfathomably low because of the COVID19 pandemic.
A few reasons for the fall in demand:
        <ol>
        <li>Low Jet fuel demand because of national and international travel restrictions.</li>
        <li>Low Fuel demand for Roads and Railways low because of lock-downs.</li>
        <li>Factories shut down, curbing the crude oil usage.</li>
        </ol>
      </li><br>
      <li><strong>The SELL Side (Supply):</strong> Now, if the supply (extraction) of oil was reduced in accordance with the decrease in demand, there was a chance to keep the oil prices afloat.<br>America, Russia and Saudi Arabia are the major players in the oil industry. The OPEC Countries promised to reduce outputs, but America wouldnâ€™t budge.
One of the major problems faced by America is that all the oil extracted went through Cushing, the single main storage hub right now. This storage facility is almost brimming with oil. Because of the relentless extraction and virtually no demand, they are running out of storage space.
